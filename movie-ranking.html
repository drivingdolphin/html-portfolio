<h1>The Best Movies According to Sophia</h1>
<h2>My top few movies I've watched</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Minions: The rise of Gru</h3>
<p>This is one of the most hilarious movies
     I've ever watched, and I just simply LOVE the little
      minions with their stubby little arms. </p>

<h3>Migration</h3>
<p>I just love the comedy in this duck based movie. </p>

<h3>The Chen Family</h3>
<p>Not a real movie, yet! Maybe I should make this movie real... </p>
